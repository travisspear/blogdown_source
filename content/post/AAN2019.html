<p>In 2019 I had the opportunity to share some of my research at the American Academy of Neurologists in Philadelphia. Here I’ll provide my poster as well as a few reasons for my excitement about the topic of literature bias in Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>
<div id="what-this-research-contributes" class="section level2">
<h2>What This Research Contributes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The largest review of Alzheimer’s literature focusing on bias</li>
<li>Expands on previous Funding bias research in Alzheimer’s Disease</li>
<li>Provides non-anecdotal exploration into Publishing Journal as a source of bias</li>
<li>Introduces Author Affiliations as a potential biasing factor</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The concept of literature bias is not new. However, most research on this topic studies internal factors such as biased groups, randomization, or unfair treatment comparisons. I wanted to investigate the impact that external factors could have on reported results. The final set of external factors were found in the metadata of studies and included <strong>Funding Source</strong>, <strong>Author Affiliations</strong>, and <strong>Publishing Journal</strong>.</p>
<div id="funding-bias" class="section level4">
<h4>Funding Bias</h4>
<p>Of these three factors, Funding bias has been investigated the most with a few dozen studies over the past decade looking into it in a variety of disease areas. Results of these studies are mixed and still very sparse in Alzheimer’s Disease. In the past, I have been cuationed against trusting pharmaceutically sponsored research due to the amount of money invested in the success of drugs - this makes sense, anecdotally, but I had never seen any evidence to prove it.</p>

<div id="journal-bias" class="section level4">
<h4>Journal Bias</h4>
<p>Journals can introduce bias in two major ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Only publishing “flashy” articles that show how great treatments are. (Who wants to read another null or negative result?)</li>
<li>Predatory journals publishing studies without a peer-review process or other quality control.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that I wanted to have large sample sizes for each subgroup, I was unable to study predatory journals here and focused on reputable journals that commonly publish Alzheimer’s research.</p>
</div>
<div id="author-affiliations" class="section level4">
<h4>Author Affiliations</h4>
<p>I was unable to find any previous research studying the potential effects of author affiliation on reported outcomes. This was a surprise as I suspsect that affiiliations and study sponsors impart pressure on the authors to succeed in their trials.</p>
